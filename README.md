PopOS-Mod

This script will automate the install of all the drivers fonts and programs I use on my Daily Driver/Gaming rig/Tablets, this is for PopOS.
*** These scrips must be ran in order. Any deviation will break your system. The "3.sh" "Surface.sh" and "testing.sh" scripts are hardware based/optional. ***

    "1.sh" to update and install essentials to configure.

    "2.sh" will install applications, fonts, and cursors (it takes several minutes to run).

    "3.sh" installs the last few Gnome extensions and modify's them. Pop doesnt always like to cooperate. Do not run this script as sudo and you may have to manually install a few extensions on the list.

    "Surface.sh" will install the necessary drivers to get a Microsoft Surface running on PopOS (Also Debian and Ubuntu have been tested with this same script...skip if not a Surface).

    "popOS-i3wm.sh" will install I3 Window manager and necessary dependancies.

    If you have multiple hard drives in your system, after you run all the scripts, edit your fstab to auto-mount your drives on boot.

    The surface bits are from: https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki but compiled into this script by me.

To install:

    Boot into your new install of PopOS and login with the user name and password you just created. Then:

sudo apt install git -y

    After Git installs:

git clone https://github.com/PiercingXX/PopOS-Mod

    Change Mod:

sudo chmod -R u+x PopOS-Mod/

    cd into install folder:

cd PopOS-Mod

    Run the first script:

sudo su

./1.sh

    After the system reboots open Terminal (not kitty):

cd PopOS-Mod

sudo su

./2.sh

    If you are using a Microsoft Surface device you can now run the script:

./Surface.sh

If you come across any issues please let me know!
